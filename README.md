# the-turn-game
A basic RPG game, except you are limited to 50 actions (turns).

The full game rules are in the python file itself, so I won't include it here.

This game is in the ALPHA state, there are still plenty of bugs and not enough features.
I'm planning to fix most by the BETA stage.
The known bugs are:
  -sometimes the turn number doesn't change, becomes 0 or negative
  -when you buy a new weapon, the game tells you that you don't have coins
  regardless of how much you actually have
  -an exploit to skip all 50 turns
  
You can also turn on Debug Features by setting ```debugFeatures``` to 1 in the file.
It will let you change coins and skip attacks.
